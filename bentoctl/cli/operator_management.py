        install operators.

        There are 3 ways to install an operator into bentoctl and they are -

        1. Interactive Mode: lists all official operators for user to choose from. Just
           type `bentoctl install` to enter this mode.

        2. Official operator: you can pass the name of one of the official operators
           and the tool with fetch it for you. You can see the list of official
           operators <link to list off operators>. eg. `bentoctl install aws-lambda`

           Available operators: [aws-lambda, aws-sagemaker, aws-ec2, azure-functions,
           azure-container-instances, google-compute-engine, google-cloud-run,
           heroku]


        3. Path: If you have the operator locally, either because you are building
           our own operator or if cloning the operator from some other
           remote repository (other than github) then you can just pass the path
           after the install command and it will register the local operator for you.
           This is a special case since the operator will not have an associated URL
           with it and hence cannot be updated using the tool.
